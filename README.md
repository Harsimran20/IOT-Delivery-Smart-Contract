### 🌡️ Temperature-Based Smart Contract

A smart contract that automates delivery and payment based on real-time temperature data from IoT devices using blockchain. Ensures secure, conditional execution of transactions in logistics and supply chains.

## 📋 Features

📶 Integrates with IoT temperature sensors

⛓️ Executes logic on blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon)

🤖 Automatically halts delivery if temperature > 30°C

💸 Ensures payment is only made if conditions are met

🔐 Tamper-proof and auditable transactions

🔄 Real-time automation without human intervention

## 🔧 How It Works

🌡️ IoT device continuously monitors environmental temperature.

🧠 Smart contract receives temperature data.

❌ If temperature > 30°C: cancel delivery and block payment.

✅ If temperature ≤ 30°C: approve delivery and release funds to Vendor A.

## 🏗️ Applications

🚛 Cold Chain Logistics: Pharmaceuticals, vaccines, or frozen food shipping where temperature breaches void contract fulfillment [1].

🌷 Floral Supply Chain: Ensures freshness and quality by enforcing temperature-controlled transit [6].

🧬 Biotech Samples: Monitors lab samples in transit to maintain integrity.

🥩 Meat & Dairy Products: Automates rejection of spoiled goods and protects buyers [5].

🌍 Sustainable Logistics: Promotes trust and transparency in eco-sensitive goods delivery [3].
